My name is Mercy Mirembe. I am a third year studying journalism at Lehigh University, with two minors in Environmental Science and Film Studies. I am a Ugandan but I was brought up primarily in Nairobi, Kenya. I am many things including but not limited to: an actor, dancer, singer, writer. I love film and television because, just like Data Storytelling, they are great tools for empathy, which is why I want to go into media. I realise that "media" is very broad, but I haven't figured out the semantics yet. All I know is that the black woman, the multicultural black woman is often under-represented and misrepresented in media (take your pick at which medium), and I want to help change that. Some of my works can be found on this site: [Idyll of Sun](idyllofsun.com)
